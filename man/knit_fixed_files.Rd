\usage{
knit_fixed_files(
  path = ".",
  pattern = "_FIXED\\\\.Rmd$",
  recursive = TRUE,
  output_dir = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE,
  clean = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string. Path to the folder containing fixed R Markdown files.
Default is current directory (".").}

\item{pattern}{Character string. Pattern to match fixed files. Default is
"_FIXED\\\\.Rmd$" to match all files ending in _FIXED.Rmd.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. If TRUE (default), searches subdirectories recursively.}

\item{output_dir}{Character string or NULL. Directory where output files should
be saved. If NULL (default), output files are saved in the same directory as
the source .Rmd file. Use this to collect all outputs in one location.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If TRUE, suppresses individual file progress messages
from rmarkdown::render(). Summary is still printed. Default is FALSE.}

\item{clean}{Logical. If TRUE (default), intermediate files generated during
knitting are removed after successful render.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item file: Input file path
\item output: Output file path (or NA if failed)
\item success: Logical indicating if knitting succeeded
\item error: Error message (or NA if succeeded)
}
}
\description{
Batch knits all fixed R Markdown files (files ending in \verb{_FIXED.Rmd}) in a
directory. Each file is knitted according to its YAML header output format,
which means custom templates and output formats are automatically respected.

This is typically used after running \code{fix_folder()} to generate final output
documents (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) for all student submissions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After fixing submissions, knit them all
fix_folder("submissions")
knit_fixed_files("submissions")

# Collect all outputs in one folder
knit_fixed_files("submissions", output_dir = "knitted_submissions")

# Quiet mode (only show summary)
knit_fixed_files("submissions", quiet = TRUE)

# Complete workflow
fix_folder("submissions", add_student_info = TRUE)
results <- knit_fixed_files("submissions")
View(results)  # See which files succeeded/failed
}
