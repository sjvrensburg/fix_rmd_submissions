\usage{
run_demo(
  demo_type = c("interactive", "quick", "custom"),
  keep_files = FALSE,
  output_dir = "fixrmdsubmissions_demo",
  auto_advance = TRUE,
  knit_outputs = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{demo_type}{Character string specifying which demo to run:
\itemize{
\item "interactive" (default): Full interactive demo with prompts and pauses
\item "quick": Quick non-interactive demo showing all features
\item "custom": Run with custom settings (see other parameters)
}}

\item{keep_files}{Logical. If TRUE, demo files are kept in a subdirectory
of the current working directory instead of being deleted. Default is FALSE
(files created in temp directory and cleaned up).}

\item{output_dir}{Character string. If keep_files = TRUE, this specifies
where to create the demo folder. Default is "fixrmdsubmissions_demo" in
the current directory.}

\item{auto_advance}{Logical. If TRUE (default), demo automatically advances
through steps. If FALSE, waits for user to press Enter between steps.
Only applies when demo_type = "interactive".}

\item{knit_outputs}{Logical. If TRUE, attempts to knit the fixed files to
HTML (requires rmarkdown and pandoc). Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with:
\itemize{
\item demo_dir: Path to demo directory
\item files_created: Character vector of created files
\item fix_results: Results from fix_folder()
\item knit_results: Results from knit_fixed_files() (if knit_outputs = TRUE)
}
}
\description{
Runs a comprehensive interactive demonstration of all fixrmdsubmissions
features in a temporary directory. The demo showcases:
\itemize{
\item Path fixing with here::here()
\item Chunk evaluation and selective disabling
\item Output limiting to prevent massive data dumps
\item Student identification (add_student_info)
\item Batch folder processing
\item Knitting fixed files to HTML/PDF
\item Backup creation
\item Transparency comments
