## Introduction

This is a typical student submission with bare file paths that won't work
when the instructor tries to knit it from a different location.

## Load Data

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r load-data}
# Student has data in their local folder but uses bare filename
scores <- read_csv("test_scores.csv")
demographics <- read.csv("demographics.csv")
```

## Analysis

```{r analysis}
summary(scores)
```

## Load Model

```{r}
# Another common issue: loading saved objects
model <- readRDS("fitted_model.rds")
```

## Note

After running fix_rmd() on this file, all bare filenames will be wrapped
with here::here("data", ...) making the paths portable and reproducible.
